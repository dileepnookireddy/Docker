Docker Storage:
---------------
 Let's walk through Docker Storage â€” how it works, types of storage, and how to use it effectively in real-world containers.

âœ… What Is Docker Storage?
Docker containers are ephemeral by default â€” data written inside a container is lost if the container is deleted.
To persist data, Docker provides several storage mechanisms.

ðŸ”¥ Main Docker Storage Types
Type	                       Description	                                              Use Case
Volumes	         Managed by Docker under /var/lib/docker/volumes	          Most common for persistent data (e.g. databases)
Bind Mounts	     Mounts a host path into the container	                    Use when you need host access (e.g. logs, configs)
tmpfs	           Temporary in-memory storage	                              For sensitive or transient data

âœ… 1. Docker Volumes (Recommended)
ðŸ”¹ Create and Use:

docker volume create mydata

docker run -d \
  --name mycontainer \
  -v mydata:/data \
  nginx

---> Data inside /data in the container is stored in the Docker volume.

ðŸ”¹ List Volumes:
docker volume ls

âœ… 2. Bind Mounts
Mount a directory from the host into the container.

docker run -d \
  --name web \
  -v /host/path:/usr/share/nginx/html \
  nginx

---> Changes on host reflect immediately inside the container.

âœ… 3. tmpfs Mounts (In-memory only)

docker run -d \
  --name temp \
  --tmpfs /app/tmp \
  nginx

--> Fast and temporary. Data disappears after container stops.

ðŸ§  Advanced: Use in docker-compose.yml

version: '3.8'
services:
  db:
    image: mysql
    volumes:
      - dbdata:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: pass123

volumes:
  dbdata:

---> Here, dbdata is a named volume, stored persistently.

âœ… Inspecting Storage
ðŸ”¹ Volume Details:
docker volume inspect mydata

ðŸ”¹ Check Usage:
du -sh /var/lib/docker/volumes/mydata/_data

âœ… When to Use What?

Use Case	               Best Option
Persistent DB Data    	 Volumes
Sharing Host Configs     Bind Mounts
In-Memory Cache	         tmpfs
